# Accordion Template Project

## Project Overview

This project is a dynamic accordion component where the content is generated from a JSON file. Users can upload or modify the JSON data in a specific file, and the accordion will automatically update itself to display the new content. No need for manual adjustments in the code!

## Features

- Dynamically updates the accordion content based on the uploaded JSON data.
- Simple and customizable accordion template.
- Minimal setup required; just update the JSON file with your data.
- Responsive design.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS**: For the accordion layout and styling.
- **JavaScript**: For handling dynamic content rendering based on JSON data.

## How It Works

1. **JSON Data Format**: The accordion's content is determined by a JSON file that you upload. Each section in the accordion corresponds to a "title" and "content" pair in the JSON file.

2. **File Structure**:
   - `data.js`: The JSON file that stores all the data for the accordion.

3. **Sample JSON Format**:
   ```json
   [
     {
       "title": "Section 1",
       "content": "This is the content for section 1."
     },
     {
       "title": "Section 2",
       "content": "This is the content for section 2."
     },
     {
       "title": "Section 3",
       "content": "This is the content for section 3."
     }
   ]
   ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/sharadgureh/accordion_template.git
